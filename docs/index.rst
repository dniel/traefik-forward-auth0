Welcome to ForwardAuth for Auth0's documentation!
=================================================

ForwardAuth for Auth0 is a authorization proxy written specifically
for use with the `Traefik`_, The Cloud Native Edge Router, and the `Auth0`_
Identity Management Platform.

`Traefik`_ will act as the gate to your applications, and the ForwardAuth
application will act as the gatekeeper and authorize requests to your
applications. Management of users, roles and permissions are handled
in Auth0.

.. caution::
    There is some important breaking changes in version 2.0 of ForwardAuth.

    **For those that want to delay upgrade from 1.0 to 2.0 version, there is
    a docker image that has been tagged 1.0 that you can continue to use, but
    it will not get any further updates and I encourage you to upgrade to 2.0 as
    soon as possible.**

    It is now mandatory to set an audience when requesting authorization.
    This change is required due to how Auth0 handles two different kinds of
    token formats, opaque tokens and jwt tokens, for access tokens. The only
    token that is possible to validate and verify is the jwt token. Therefor
    its from now on required to set the audience in the application config
    and the application will not work otherwise.

    The version 2.0 configuration also has some new fields that need to be
    set for the application to start up. See :doc:`Upgrade Notes <start/upgrade-notes>`
    for information about compatability and upgrades between versions. The page
    :doc:`Configuration <start/configuration>` should have a update to date
    example for the latest version.
