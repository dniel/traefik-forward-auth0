# The definition of the router and service for auth.example.test
# and the url set to http://host.docker.internal:8080 to be used
# when running ForwardAuth externally from Docker Compose to be
# able to run ForwardAuth during development in an development
# environment and the rest of the Docker Compose containers for
# testing of features.
# 
# The ForwardAuth service must then be commented out in the
# docker-compose.yaml file and started manually on your computer
# for example in IntelliJ IDEA or another IDE where the code
# is written.
